The scPipeline is a pipeline using scanpy to do single-cell analysis. We hope to make new additions to that soon.

## Installation

1. First, make sure you have miniconda or conda set up. IF using Biowulf, first set up conda in your data directory, or use the miniconda modules on biowulf.

2. Then, install create a new environment in this directory using
```
conda env create -p scPipeline_env/ -f env_requirements.yml
```
3. Activate the environment using `conda activate -p scPipeline_env/` and you're almost ready to go.
